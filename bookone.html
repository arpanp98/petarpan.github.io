		"Underneath our feet the ground shook, the railings shook and the wires crackled. None of us could see, hear, and barely breathe. 
		Air came preciously in those few seconds we were allowed to raise our heads, and we gasped it in gratefully. 
		Here we were, six huddled bodies shuffling our feet against the earth below.  We could hear the barks of the dogs after us, 
		and this kept our blood churning. We had gone maybe six or seven miles like that, no food, not water except the sweat of the person 
		in front of you. There was really no question to whether we would make it or not. I think all of us were bound to an unspoken faith 
		that we would have to. I think it was maybe twenty more minutes of that when I first saw a little bit of light, it was a hole 
		in the ground above us. I remember stopping, we weren't supposed to stop you know, and I stopped and just climb up the railing 
		and shoved my head through. Before I could see anything someone yanked me back down, but that air in my lungs. 
		It made the shuffling worthwhile."
